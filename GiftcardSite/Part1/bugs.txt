The cross site scripting attack test case takes the form of a supplied URL (within "xss.txt") and exploits the vulnerable URL parameter "director":

127.0.0.1:8000/gift?director=<script>alert("Hello‚Äù)</script>

Within the template titled "gift.html" - we noticed that the URL parameter, "director", is vulnerable.
The reason behind this vulnerability is because auto-escaping has been turned off for the URL parameter "director" with the "safe" filter in gift.html.
This vulnerability can be found in line 60 of "gift.html" and the vulnerability starts with: <p>Endorsed by {{director|safe}}!</p>
