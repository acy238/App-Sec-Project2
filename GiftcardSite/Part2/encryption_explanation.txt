Within models.py under our LegacySite directory, we encrypted the "data" variable of our "Card" class model. We choose this encryption key because:
  There is a vulnerability within our card query on line 188 of views.py that starts with:
    card_query = Card.objects.raw('select id from LegacySite_card where data = \'%s\'' % signature)
  Because the placeholder (%s) is quoted -> this should be unquoted to be protected. 
  The placeholder is substituted for data's value because of the SQL code that is trying to filter/match the data column's value with the keyword: (where)
  With all the values in the data column encrypted, it would be protected from SQL injections.
